This is a functional password manager. It allows the user to input a website, their username, and password and then stores it into a json file.
The passwords are encrypted using the cryptography import from python before they are stored in the json file with a private key.
The password manager allows users to add passwords, view all saved passwords, search for a specific password which has been stored, delete a password,
clear the entire json file to reset the database, and generate a strong password. The strong password is generated using a combination of
uppercase and lowercase letters, all numbers, and a limited amount of special characters to ensure it can be used for most websites.
