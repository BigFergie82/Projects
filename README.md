This is a project from my introduction to Computer Network and Systems class. 
It uses a TCP connection between a server and a client in order for the client to submit queries to the server and search for words from the text file. 
It also allows for the searches to contain 'wildcards' where a ? is used in place of a blank letter. 
For example, if the query a?t is submitted, all words three letter words starting with a and ending with t will show up in the results.
